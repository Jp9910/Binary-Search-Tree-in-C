# Binary-Search-Tree-in-C
This project implements a binary search tree in C, and simulates its use by reading data from a text file passed as argument to the program. It then traverses the tree in 3 ways - Inorder, Preorder and Postorder - to write the information read in a text file also passed as argument to the program.
